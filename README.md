# AI Startup Idea Refinement Agent

This project is a functional prototype of an AI-powered reasoning agent designed to help entrepreneurs refine and evolve their startup ideas through structured, iterative feedback.

It simulates a conversation with a strategic advisor  analyzing an idea, identifying market gaps, and suggesting creative directions. It also tracks the entire refinement process step by step.
